    content: `# Lessons from a Technical Due Diligence

Technical due diligence (TDD) is a critical step in the investment process for tech companies. As someone who has been on both sides of the table—having my own company evaluated and evaluating others—I've gathered insights on how to navigate this process successfully.

## What Is Technical Due Diligence?

Technical due diligence is a thorough evaluation of a company's technical assets, including:

- Codebase and architecture
- Engineering team and processes
- Technical debt and scalability
- Security practices and compliance
- Product development methodology
- Intellectual property

The goal is to identify both risks and opportunities from a technical perspective before an investment, acquisition, or major partnership.

## What Investors Are Really Looking For

Beyond the surface-level checklist items, investors use TDD to evaluate several deeper questions:

### 1. Is the technology foundation sound?

They want to know if your technology can support growth without requiring a complete rewrite. Key indicators include:

- Architectural decisions that allow for scaling
- Appropriate use of third-party services vs. custom development
- Test coverage and deployment practices
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

### 2. Can the team execute effectively?

The strength of your engineering team is often more important than the current state of your technology:

- Team composition and experience
- Engineering leadership and decision-making processes
- Velocity and predictability of delivery
- Problem-solving approach and technical creativity

### 3. Do you understand your technical risks?

Self-awareness about technical challenges is crucial:

- Transparency about known issues and technical debt
- Realistic assessment of scaling challenges
- Understanding of competitive technical advantages and disadvantages
- Clear roadmap for addressing critical limitations

## How to Prepare for Technical Due Diligence

### Documentation to Prepare

1. **System architecture diagrams** (high-level and detailed)
2. **Technology stack inventory** (languages, frameworks, databases, services)
3. **Development and release processes**
4. **Team structure and responsibilities**
5. **Security and compliance documentation**
6. **Disaster recovery and business continuity plans**
7. **Metrics on system performance and reliability**
8. **Roadmap for technical improvements**

### Process Preparation

1. **Conduct an internal pre-due diligence review**
2. **Prepare your team for interviews** without scripting answers
3. **Gather metrics that demonstrate your engineering effectiveness**
4. **Document known issues and your plans to address them**
5. **Clean up code repositories and documentation**

## Common Red Flags for Investors

### Technical Debt Without a Plan

Some level of technical debt is expected, but investors get concerned when:
- There's no clear inventory of technical debt
- The team doesn't have a prioritized plan for addressing critical issues
- Technical decisions are consistently sacrificing long-term stability

### Overreliance on Key Individuals

A "bus factor" of one or two for critical systems is a major risk:
- Knowledge concentrated in a few individuals
- Lack of documentation or knowledge transfer processes
- Insufficient cross-training among team members

### Mismatch Between Claims and Reality

The fastest way to lose credibility is by overselling your technical capabilities:
- Exaggerating the maturity of features or infrastructure
- Minimizing known scaling challenges
- Misrepresenting the state of security or compliance

## Turning Due Diligence into an Advantage

The most successful companies view TDD not just as a hurdle but as an opportunity:

1. **Use outside expertise as free consulting** to improve your systems
2. **Demonstrate transparency and problem-solving** rather than perfect technology
3. **Highlight your understanding of risk** and thoughtful approach to managing it
4. **Show off your team's abilities** through their interaction with technical evaluators

Remember that most investors expect challenges—what they're evaluating is how well you understand those challenges and your ability to address them.`,

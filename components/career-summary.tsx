                I am an engineering leader who has worked in the technology industry for 15 years. Over the last 5 years, I have moved into a leadership role, from a hands-on technical lead, with line management responsibilities, to 
                more recently an engineering manager, managing multiple teams. In addition to my management skills, I also come from a full-stack software engineering background and have contributed either directly or by leadership of my engineering teams on large-scale projects.

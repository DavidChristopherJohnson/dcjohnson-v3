                I am an engineering leader who has worked in the technology industry for 15 years. Over the last 5 years I have moved into a leadership role, from a hands on technical lead, with line management responsibilities, to more recently an engineering manager, managing multiple teams. In addition to my management skills, I also come from a full stack software engineering background, and have contributed either directly or by leadership of my engineering teams on large scale projects.
